        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>As a data analyst, I've learned the value of extracting valuable solutions from data of all types. Using tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau to analyze large datasets and generate meaningful reports has helped hone my skills in data-driven decision-making. I have a range of professional experience including roles as an online data analyst with TELUS Digital, procurement coordinator for the Tennessee Secretary of State, and research assistant at the University of Tennessee. I completed my MBA at Tennessee Technological University, where I gained high-level management, data analysis, and public speaking skills. Currently located in my hometown of Nashville, TN, I am open to local and remote positions as a data analyst.</p>
